# Inventory Optimization & Demand Alignment using Power BI  
### Client Case Study – Manufacturing (Bike Industry)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on solving critical inventory management challenges for a bike manufacturing company (**Exodus Bike**).  
The client was facing frequent production delays due to stockouts of critical components, while simultaneously holding excessive inventory in slow-moving parts.

These inefficiencies were impacting:
- Cash flow  
- Forecasting accuracy  
- Procurement planning  

Using **Power BI**, I designed an end-to-end inventory analytics solution to improve visibility, optimize stock levels, and enable data-driven purchasing decisions.

## ⚠️ Business Problems
The client was struggling with multiple inventory-related issues:

- Frequent stockouts of critical components, causing production delays  
- Overstocking of low-moving parts, leading to capital being locked in inventory  
- Poor alignment between sales and inventory, reducing forecast accuracy  
- Limited visibility into optimal reorder levels and inventory risks  

---

## 🛠 Solution Approach
I developed a structured **Power BI dashboard** that provided both high-level inventory health monitoring and deep-dive analytical insights.

---

### 1️⃣ Inventory Overview & Risk Monitoring
This page was designed to give management a quick snapshot of inventory health.

**Key KPIs Tracked**
- Inventory Cost  
- Quantity In Hand  
- Quantity Sold / Withdrawn  
- Inventory Turnover  
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)  
- Inventory Coverage  

**Key Logic & Insights**
- Inventory Coverage classification:
  - **Overstocked**: > 6 months  
  - **Understocked**: < 1 month  
  - **Normal**: 1–6 months  
- Highlighted stockout risks for urgent action  
- Compared Quantity Withdrawn vs Quantity In Hand to identify slow-moving parts  
- Sales value by product group to prioritize high-impact categories  

---

### 2️⃣ Inventory Level & Demand Flow Analysis
Focused on understanding demand patterns and inventory flow efficiency.

- Monthly comparison of **Sales vs Average Stock**  
- Quarterly analysis of **Quantity Sold vs Quantity At Hand**  
- Inventory Turnover by Product Group  
- **Sankey Diagram** to track inventory flow:
  - Location → Model → Product Group  

This helped identify bottlenecks and overstock concentration areas.

---

### 3️⃣ Pareto (ABC) Analysis
Applied the Pareto principle to support strategic inventory decisions.

- Ranked parts by **Quantity Withdrawn**  
- Identified the critical few parts driving most demand  
- Reduced overstock in low-impact items  

---

## 📈 Business Impact
- Significant reduction in stockouts of critical parts  
- Improved control over excess and slow-moving inventory  
- Optimized inventory coverage and working capital  
- More accurate forecasting and data-driven purchasing  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Data Modeling  
- Business-Focused Dashboard Design

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how inventory analytics can transform decision-making from reactive to proactive.  
By aligning sales demand with inventory planning, the client achieved better cost control, smoother production, and smarter purchasing decisions.
