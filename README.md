Inventory Optimization & Demand Alignment using Power BI

Client Case Study – Manufacturing (Bike Industry)

Project Overview

This project focuses on solving critical inventory management challenges for a bike manufacturing company (Exodus Bike). The client was facing frequent production delays due to stockouts of critical components, while simultaneously holding excessive inventory in slow-moving parts. These inefficiencies were impacting cash flow, forecasting accuracy, and procurement planning.

Using Power BI, I designed an end-to-end inventory analytics solution to improve visibility, optimize stock levels, and enable data-driven purchasing decisions.

Business Problems

The client was struggling with multiple inventory-related issues:

Frequent stockouts of critical components, causing production delays

Overstocking of low-moving parts, leading to capital being locked in inventory

Poor alignment between sales and inventory, reducing forecast accuracy

Limited visibility into optimal reorder levels and inventory risks

Solution Approach

I developed a structured Power BI dashboard that provided both high-level inventory health monitoring and deep-dive analytical insights.

1. Inventory Overview & Risk Monitoring

This page was designed to give management a quick snapshot of inventory health.

Key KPIs Tracked

Inventory Cost

Quantity In Hand

Quantity Sold / Withdrawn

Inventory Turnover

Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)

Inventory Coverage

Key Logic & Insights

Inventory Coverage classification:

Overstocked: > 6 months

Understocked: < 1 month

Normal: 1–6 months

Identification of stockout risks for immediate action

Comparison of Quantity Withdrawn vs Quantity In Hand to detect slow-moving and excess stock

Sales value analysis by product group to prioritize high-impact categories

2. Inventory Level & Demand Flow Analysis

This section focused on understanding demand patterns and inventory flow efficiency.

Analytical Views

Monthly comparison of Sales vs Average Stock to identify overstock trends and low turnover periods

Quarterly analysis of Quantity Sold vs Quantity At Hand to highlight demand-supply mismatches

Inventory Turnover by Product Group to assess operational efficiency

Sankey Visualization showing inventory movement across:

Location → Model → Product Group
This helped uncover bottlenecks and overstock concentration areas

3. Pareto (ABC) Analysis for Strategic Focus

To support smarter inventory prioritization, I applied the Pareto principle:

Ranked parts based on Quantity Withdrawn

Identified the critical few items contributing to the majority of demand

Enabled reduction of overstock in low-impact parts while protecting high-demand components

Business Impact

The Power BI solution delivered measurable operational improvements:

Significant reduction in stockouts of critical parts

Improved control over excess and slow-moving inventory

Optimized inventory coverage and working capital utilization

More accurate forecasting and data-driven purchasing decisions

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can transform inventory management from reactive decision-making to a proactive, insight-driven process. By aligning sales demand with inventory planning, the client gained better control over costs, production continuity, and strategic purchasing.
